\description{
Given a \eqn{q}-dimensional random vector \eqn{\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{X}_{1},...,\mathbf{X}_{k})} with \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{i}} a \eqn{d_{i}}-dimensional random vector, i.e., \eqn{q = d_{1} + ... + d_{k}},
this function construct a hac object (hierarchical Archimedean copula) with two nesting levels given
the specified dimensions and parameters of the root and \eqn{k} child copulas.
}
\details{
A hierarchical (or nested) Archimedean copula \eqn{C} with two nesting levels and \eqn{k} child copulas is given by
\deqn{C(\mathbf{u}) = C_{0} \left (C_{1}(\mathbf{u}_{1}), \dots, C_{k}(\mathbf{u}_{k}) \right ),}
where \eqn{\mathbf{u} = (\mathbf{u}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{u}_{k}) \in \mathbb{R}^{q}} with \eqn{\mathbf{u}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i}}} for \eqn{i = 1, \dots, k}.
The (\eqn{k}-dimensional) copula \eqn{C_{0}} is called the root copula, and the (\eqn{d_{i}}-dimensional) copulas \eqn{C_{i}} are the child copulas.

They all belong to the class of Archimedean copulas, and we denote \eqn{\theta_{i}} for the parameter of \eqn{C_{i}} for \eqn{i = 0,1,\dots,k}.
A sufficient condition to guarantee that \eqn{C} indeed is a copula, is that \eqn{C_{0},C_{1}, \dots, C_{k}} are all a particular member of this class of Archimedean copulas (e.g., Clayton),
and such that \eqn{\theta_{0} \leq \theta_{i}} for \eqn{i = 1, \dots, k} (sufficient nesting condition).

When a certain child copula \eqn{C_{i}} is one dimensional (\eqn{\mathbf{X}_{i}} is one dimensional), \eqn{\theta_{i}} can be any number.
It must hold that length(thetas) \eqn{ =  k + 1}.

Many functions for working with nested Archimedean copulas are developed in the R package \sQuote{HAC},
and the function \code{\link{gethac}} utilizes these functions to quickly construct a hac object that is useful for modelling
the dependence between \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{X}_{k}}.
See also the R package \sQuote{HAC} for the different possibilities of type (specified by a number in \eqn{\{1,\dots,10\}}).

\examples{
dim = c(3,5,1,2)
thetas = c(2,2,3,1,4)

# 11 dimensional nested Gumbel copula with
# (theta_0,theta_1,theta_2,theta_3,theta_4) = (2,2,3,1,4),
# where the value of theta_3 could be anything,
# because the third random vector is one dimensional

HAC = gethac(dim,thetas,type = 1)
