#' @title otsort

#' @description Given a \eqn{q}-dimensional random vector \eqn{\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{X}_{1},...,\mathbf{X}_{k})} with \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{i}} a \eqn{d_{i}}-dimensional random vector, i.e., \eqn{q = d_{1} + ... + d_{k}},
#' this function sorts the columns (variables) of a sample of \eqn{\mathbf{X}} such that the dimensions are in ascending order.
#'
#' @param sample A sample from a \eqn{q}-dimensional random vector \eqn{\mathbf{X}} (\eqn{n \times q} matrix with observations in rows, variables in columns).
#' @param dim  The vector of dimensions \eqn{(d_{1},...,d_{k})}, in order as given in sample.
#'
#' @details
#' The columns of sample are rearranged such that the data corresponding to the random vector \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{i}}
#' having the smallest dimension \eqn{d_{i}} comes first, then the random vector with second smallest dimension, and so on.
#'
#' @return A list with elements "sample" containing the ordered sample, and "dim" containing the ordered dimensions.
#' @examples
#' q = 10
#' n = 50
#' dim = c(2,3,1,4)
#'
#' # Sample from multivariate normal distribution
#' sample = mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n,rep(0,q),diag(q), method = "chol")
#'
#' ordered = otsort(sample,dim)
